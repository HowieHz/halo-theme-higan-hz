## Important Notes

This theme has been optimized with code splitting, reduced external dependencies, and minimized single-page resource sizes. Please note the following during use:

1. Avoid referencing extremely slow resources: such as huge images or public CDN resources with poor accessibility.
2. Deploy CDN when possible: Personal sites are limited by bandwidth and server performance. Using CDN for static resources can significantly improve loading speed.
3. Use modern image formats: such as `WebP` and `AVIF`, which can reduce image size while maintaining equivalent image quality.
4. Use modern font formats: If using custom fonts, prefer the `woff2` format, which offers significant improvements over `woff` and `ttf`.
